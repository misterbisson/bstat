### = History =

bStat is a reboot of the stats components of bSuite, which was the outgrowth of the original bStat plugin. In a way, things have come full circle, but this plugin does not read or use data gathered by the old plugins. The focus of this plugin is now more narrowly aimed at recent and streaming activty, not deep history.
